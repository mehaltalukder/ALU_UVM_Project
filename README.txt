* This is a project to verify a simple ALU design using UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) and SystemVerilog. 
* To run the simulation using a simulator like Questa just run the "run_alu.do" file in the simulator using the following command
- do run_alu.do
* You can also compile and run the files using any other simulator at edaplayground
